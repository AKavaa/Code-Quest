# 🧠 Code-Quest  

### A Game for Developing Algorithmic Thinking Skills

**Algorithmic Quest** is an interactive platform designed to help learners strengthen their problem-solving and algorithmic thinking abilities through coding challenges — but with a twist:  
each challenge is presented as part of a **game-like journey** where logic, creativity, and efficiency determine your progress.

## 🚧 Current Status
> **In Development**  
The project is actively being developed by Aleksander Kavaleuskiy and Giorgos Tafouna.  
We are currently designing the core system architecture and challenge mechanics.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision
Our goal is to make learning algorithms **fun, visual, and rewarding** — transforming the way people practice coding.  
Instead of plain text problems, users will **play their way through algorithmic challenges**, level up, and unlock more complex problem types.

## 🕹️ Planned Features (In Progress)
- 🧩 **Interactive Coding Challenges** – practice algorithms through dynamic puzzles and tasks.  
- 🎮 **Game Progression System** – complete levels to unlock harder challenges and earn rewards.   
- 🔍 **Algorithm Visualizer** – see how your solution executes step by step.  
- 🌐 **Cross-Language Support** – solve problems in multiple programming languages.
